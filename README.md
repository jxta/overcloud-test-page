[Description]
In our paper 'Improve Practical Matrix Sketching with Guarantees' we introduce three algorithms Parametrized Frequent Direction, Space Saving Direction, Compensative Frequent Direction. We provide code and datasets for our new algorithms, as well as existing algorithms for Frequent Direction, ISVD, Random Projections, Hashing, Sampling. We encourage other researchers to reproduce our results and any other variation they would like to perform. Code + Data in /local/FreqDir
